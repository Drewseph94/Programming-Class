In class, we started a clock program. This program can create a clock object, set the
time for the clock, and print a display of the clock's time. I want you to now implement
three more member functions for the clock class: incrementHours(int hours),
incrementMinutes(int minutes), and incrementSeconds(int seconds). These three functions
should increase the current time on the clock by the amount specified by the parameter.

Some advice: Start by implementing incrementHour, then incrementMinutes, and finally
incrementSeconds. The reason is that incrementMinutes will probably need to call incrementHours,
and incrementSeconds will likely call incrementMinutes.

Don't forget to update AM/PM accordingly.

Sample Output

Creating a clock, initialized for 6:00 PM
6:00:00 PM
Adding 15 hours to the clock using clock.incrementHours(15)
9:00:00 AM
Adding 135 minutes to the clock using clock.incrementMinutes(135)
11:15:00 AM
Adding 12345 seconds to the clock using clock.incrementSeconds(12345)
2:40:45 PM
