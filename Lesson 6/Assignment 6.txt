This assignment has only one part, and it is similar to the rectangle problem we did in class.

I would like to know how you are all progressing on these exercises. As you complete them,
please email me your work. You can find your projects in the following directory:

I am providing you the main function for you to use in your project. Simply copy it into
your Main class and do not modify it. Your job is to create the Circle class that I reference
in main. Specifically, add functionality for the following functions:

- public Circle(double radiusIn) // This is the constructor
- public double getDiameter()
- public double getCircumference()
- public double getArea() 
- public static Circle circleAdd(Circle circle1, Circle circle2)

Do accomplish this, you will need to know the following Java Math operations:

- Math.PI // = 3.14159...
- Math.pow(b, e) // power function, take b to the e power
- Math.sqrt(n) // square root of n

Note - the circleAdd function is the trickiest function in this program. First it is a static
function, so remember what that means. Second, it returns a Circle object, so you will have
to instantiate a Circle object within it as some point. Finally, note what it has to do:
Given 2 circles, calculate the areas of both of them, add these areas together, and create
another circle with an area equal to this sum. That should be some fun math for you.

Here is the main function I want you to use.

public static void main(String[] args) {
	System.out.println("Create a circle with a radius of 5.5");
	Circle circle1 = new Circle(5.5);
	System.out.println("Circle 1 Diameter: " + circle1.getDiameter());
	System.out.println("Circle 1 Circumference: " + circle1.getCircumference());
	System.out.println("Circle 1 Area: " + circle1.getArea());
	
	System.out.println("\nCreate a circle with a radius of 7.8");
	Circle circle2 = new Circle(7.8);
	System.out.println("Circle 2 Diameter: " + circle2.getDiameter());
	System.out.println("Circle 2 Circumference: " + circle2.getCircumference());
	System.out.println("Circle 2 Area: " + circle2.getArea());
	
	System.out.println("\nCreate a circle with an area equal to the sum of the previous circles");
	Circle circle3 = Circle.circleAdd(circle1, circle2);
	System.out.println("Circle 3 Diameter: " + circle3.getDiameter());
	System.out.println("Circle 3 Circumference: " + circle3.getCircumference());
	System.out.println("Circle 3 Area: " + circle3.getArea());
}
