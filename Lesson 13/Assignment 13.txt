Implement Insersion Sort, similar to how we implemented Bubble Sort and Selection Sort
in class. Insertion sort works like this:

1. Start with the left-most element. (Do nothing in this case)
2. Move the the next-right element. While is it less than the element to its left, swap
3. Repeat step 2 for all elements

Example:

3 1 5 2 6 4 - Starting with 3, do nothing

3 1 5 2 6 4 - Looking at 1 now, it is less than the element to its left, so swap
1 3 5 2 6 4 - 1 has no elements to its left, so we are done.

1 3 5 2 6 4 - Looking at 5 now, it is not less than the element to its left, so do nothing

1 3 5 2 6 4 - Looking at 2 now, it is less than the element to its left, so swap
1 3 2 5 6 4 - 2 still is less than the element to its left, so swap
1 2 3 5 6 4 - 2 is not less than the element to its left, so we are done with it

1 2 3 5 6 4 - Looking at 6 now, it is not less than the element to its left, so do nothing

1 2 3 5 6 4 - Looking at 4 now, it is less than the element to its left, so swap
1 2 3 5 4 6 - Still less then the element to its left, so swap
1 2 3 4 5 6 - 4 is not less than the element to its left, so we are done with it

Done
