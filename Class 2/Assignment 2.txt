Assignment 2

This assignement has 2 parts. The first part will ask you to add functionality
to the guessing number program we worked on in class. The second part will test
your logic and understanding of the concepts covered to find the answer to a puzzle.

I would like to know how you are all progressing on these exercises. As you complete them,
please email me your work. You can find your projects in the following directory:

Part 1

Add the following functions to the number guessing program. You may start with
the code I provided.

1. Only allow the user to guess a certain number of times. If they fail to pick
the secret number after that many guesses show that they ~lost the game~. As they
are guessing, indicate how many guesses they have left.

2. Add a fourth difficulty option called Custom. When this is picked, allow the user
to set the minimum and maximum values that the secret number can be, as well as the
number of guesses they get.

Bonus: A user may not know a reasonable number of guesses when they pick a min and max
for the secret number. Therefore, come up with an algorithm in your code to determine
what a good guess count would be for any range of numbers. Here is a starting point to
get you thinking:

	Easy (1-10): 3-4 guesses
	Medium (1-100): 6-8 guesses
	Hard (1-1000): 9-11 guesses.

If the user enters "0" for the number of guesses, allow your program to calculate how
many guesses they should get.

----------------
Sample Output:

Let's play the guessing game!

1: Easy
2: Medium
3: Hard
4: Custom

Enter a difficulty: 4
Enter min value for the secret number: 30
Enter max value for the secret number: 110
Enter number of guesses: 0

Guess the number between 30 and 110 (6 guesses left): 70
Wrong, guess lower.

Guess the number between 30 and 110 (5 guesses left): 50
Wrong, guess lower.

Guess the number between 30 and 110 (4 guesses left): 40
Wrong, guess higher.

Guess the number between 30 and 110 (3 guesses left): 45
Wrong, guess higher.

Guess the number between 30 and 110 (2 guesses left): 47
Wrong, guess higher.

Guess the number between 30 and 110 (1 guess left): 49
Game over, you lost.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
