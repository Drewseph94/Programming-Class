Assignment 1

This assignment has 2 parts. The first part should be similar to what we covered in the lesson.
The second part will require you to apply what you learned to figure out a solution.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 1

Allow the user to input 3 numbers. For convenience, I will refer to these numbers as A, B, and C.
After the user enters these 3 numbers, output the following 5 calculations:

A + B
B - C
A * C
(A + B) / (B - C)
(A + B + C) % C

For the division calculation, I want you to return an integer rounded to the nearest whole value.
For example, 2.3 -> 2 and 2.7 -> 3.

* Note that % is called the modulus operator. It divides the first number by the second number
and returns the remainder. This means that 7 % 3 = 1, 8 % 3 = 2, and 9 % 3 = 0.
It is a very useful operator and we will be putting it to use soon, so get acquainted with it now.

----------------
Sample Output:

Enter number 1: 2
Enter number 2: 6
Enter number 3: 3
2 + 6 = 8
6 - 3 = 3
2 * 3 = 6
(2 + 6) / (6 - 3) = 3
(2 + 6 + 3) % 3 = 2

----------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2

You are writing a program for a carpet store. This store sells carpet at $7.65 per square foot.
Your program should be able to input the length and width of a floor to be carpeted, in INCHES.
The input will only be whole inches, no decimal inches. With this input, calculate how much
it would cost to carpet the whole floor, to the nearest cent. Do not output fractional cents.

----------------
Sample Output:

Enter floor length: 12
Enter floor width: 12
Price: $7.65

Enter floor length: 24
Enter floor width: 24
Price: $30.6

Enter floor length: 1
Enter floor width: 1
Price: $0.05

Enter floor length: 27
Enter floor width: 31
Price: $44.47

Enter floor length: 159
Enter floor width: 425
Price: $3589.92
